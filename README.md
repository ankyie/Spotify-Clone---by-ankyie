## FAQ

#### Q) How do I make my own album and add music to it?

A) Make a Folder inside the "songs" Folder and add songs/music inside it.

To give the album a cover, along with title and description; do this:


Step 1:
```
use a 1:1 image (preferably) and add the image in individual folders inside the songs folder. Then rename the images to "cover.jpg".
```

Step 2:
```
make an "info.json" and write:
```
```json
{
    "title": "<insert your album title here>",
    "description": "<insert your album description here>"
}
```
